* Version 1.0 (v1.0) cat clicker duo
* Version 2.0 (v2.0) cat clicker Premium

#### Project Requirements for Cat Clicker Premium
#####Â Visuals
* The application should display
    [x] a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
    [x] an area to display the selected cat
* In the cat display area, the following should be displayed

    [x] the cat's name
    [x] a picture of the cat
    [x] text showing the number of clicks
    [x] The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

##### Interaction
*
    [x] When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
    [x] The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
